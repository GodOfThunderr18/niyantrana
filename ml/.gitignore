--- IMPORTANT NOTE ON LARGE FILES ---
The 'models/' directory and large files in 'data/raw/' are NOT listed here.
This is because they SHOULD be tracked by Git.
Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for these files to avoid bloating the repository history.
Example Git LFS commands:
git lfs track "models/*.h5"
git lfs track "models/*.pkl"
git lfs track "data/raw/*.csv"
git lfs track "data/raw/*.xlsx"
